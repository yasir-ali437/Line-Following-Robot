\section{Abstract}
Line Following is one of the most important aspects of robotics. A Line Following Robot is an
autonomous robot which is able to follow a black line that is drawn on the surface consisting of a
contrasting color. It is designed to move automatically and follow the line. The robot uses arrays
of optical sensors to identify the line, thus assisting the robot to stay on the track. The array of
five sensors makes its movement precise and flexible. The robot is driven by DC gear motors to
control the movement of the wheels. The Micro-controller TIVA Board (Cortex M-4
TM4C1233H6PM) interface will be used to perform and implement algorithms to control the
speed of the motors, steering the robot to travel along the line smoothly. This project aims to
implement the algorithm and control the movement of the robot by proper tuning of the control
parameters using PID controller and thus achieve better performance.

\section{Working Principle}
The line following robot is one of the self-operating robots. That detects and follows a line drawn on the area. The line is indicated by black line on a white surface. This system must be sense by the line. This application is depends upon the sensors. Here we are using an array of five sensors for path detection purpose. That is proximity sensor and IR sensor. The proximity sensor used for path detection and IR sensor used for obstacle detection. These sensors mounted at front end of the robot. The micro controller is an intelligent device the whole circuit is controlled by the micro controller.
\includegraphics[scale=.8]{Capture.png}\\

The IR LED on getting proper biasing emits Infra red light. This IR light is reflected in case of a white surface and the reflected IR light is incident on the photo-diode. The resistance of the photo-diode decreases, which leads to an increase in current through it and thus the voltage drop across it. The photodiode is connected to the base of the transistor and as a result of increased voltage across the photodiode, the transistor starts conducting and thus the motor connected to the collector of the transistor gets enough supply to start rotating. In case of a black color on the path encountered by one of the sensor arrangement, the IR light is not reflected and the photo-diode offers more resistance, causing the transistor to stop conduction and eventually the motor stops rotating.

\section{Applications of Line Follower Robot}
\textbf{

\section{Result and Analysis}
\textbf{
Speed Control(PWM):}
The speed of the dc motor is control by feeding PWM from Tiva to the enable pin of the L293D which change the voltage across the motor. Due to which speed is also decreased. On the command over the speed and the direction is also controlled. 
\begin{center}

We created PWM using the two timers(tim0,tim1) of Tiva. For the protection of Tiva board we are using opto-couplers. PWM first goes to opto-couplers and then to the motor driver.\\

Using different conditions depending on the position of Array sensor, we use different duty cycles of PWM. As a result of different duty cycles, the line follower is able to follow a black line.

\textbf{
Practical Result Analysis:}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|r|}
\hline
\textbf {Duty Cycle} & \textbf Voltage Across Motor  &\textbf{RPM} \\
\hline
0 & 0 & 0 \\
25 & 3 & 16 \\
50 & 6 & 29 \\
75 & 9 & 45\\
100 & 12 & 58\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\bigbreak
\end{center}
The above table shows the voltage across motor and RPM at different values of duty cycle. As we increase duty cycle the voltage across motor increase accordingly, so is the RPM.
